# Wordle_SFML
The basic Wordle game developed in SFML.  
  
I used [Squirrelbear's project](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/Wordle-CPP-SMFL) as a reference and then I modified it with some personal changes:
* Added a day/night mode for the sharing string (you can share it on Discord to see the result)
* Changed the typo so it looks better
* Checked if the word introduced is an existing word when a guess is written
* Updated the word database so it has easier and more understandable words

Future possible changes:
* Add more words to the word database so the game has more variety
* Adapt the game so it has the ability to be played either in Spanish or in English
* Switch in between day/night mode inside the game

Hope you like it! ~Mark
