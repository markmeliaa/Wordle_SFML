# Wordle_SFML
The basic Wordle game developed in SFML.  
  
The idea was to mimic [Squirrelbear's project](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/Wordle-CPP-SMFL) and then update their idea with some personal changes:
* Added a day/night mode for the sharing string (you can share it on Discord to see the result)
* Changed the typo so it looks better
* Checked if a word introduced is an existing word before comparing with the solution
* Updated the word database so it has easier and more understandable words

Future possible changes:
* Add more words to the word database so the game has more variety
* Adapt the game so it has the ability to be played either in Spanish or in English
* Switch in between day/night mode inside the game

Hope you like it! ~Mark
